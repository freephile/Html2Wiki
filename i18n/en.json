Also all files will be grouped in a category by the same name. For example, let's say you're importing a collection of HTML files output from your software documentation system, you would enter a unique Collection ID like 'FluxCapacitor-v1.1' so that the whole collection is imported into an article hierarchy starting with 'FluxCapacitor-v1.1'. This way 10 different collections can be imported without clobbering each other.\n\nSpecifying an existing Collection Name (or parent path) will update existing wiki content.\n\nIf you want to import a single file into an existing article hierarchy, simply specify it's 'parent' as the Collection Name.\n\nFor example, if importing a new 'advanced_topics.html' that should exist at <code>'FluxCapacitor-v1.1/docs/advanced_topics.html'</code>, the parent would be 'FluxCapacitor-v1.1/docs/'",
